# Privacy Policy for Dobby Reply Assistant

**Last Updated: December 2024**

## Overview

Dobby Reply Assistant ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our AI-powered Twitter reply assistant.

## Data Collection and Usage

**Dobby Reply Assistant does not collect or store any personally identifiable information.** The extension processes tweet content locally in the browser to generate AI-powered reply suggestions. When the user requests an AI reply, only the relevant text (e.g., tweet content or user input) is securely sent to the Fireworks AI API for response generation.

### What We Process:
- **Tweet Content**: Only the specific tweet text you choose to reply to
- **User Input**: Any additional context you provide
- **API Keys**: Your Fireworks AI API key (stored locally only)

### What We DON'T Collect:
- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Other website data
- User accounts or profiles
- Location data
- Device information

## Data Sharing

**No data is shared with third parties beyond the Fireworks AI service**, which acts solely as an inference layer to return text suggestions. Responses are handled as plain text and are not executed as code.

### Third-Party Services:
- **Fireworks AI**: Used only for AI inference when you request a reply
- **Render.com**: Hosts our API server (no data storage)

## Storage and Retention

**User preferences such as tone settings or API keys are stored locally in Chrome's storage.local and never transmitted externally.** No data is retained on the server after responses are generated.

### Local Storage:
- Your Fireworks AI API key (encrypted in Chrome's local storage)
- Extension preferences (tone, length settings)
- No data is synced to the cloud

### Server Storage:
- **No persistent data storage** on our servers
- API requests are processed and immediately discarded
- No logs of your tweet content or replies

## Security

**All communication with Fireworks API endpoints occurs over HTTPS.** The extension does not load or execute remote code, ensuring compliance with Chrome Web Store policies and protecting user data integrity.

### Security Measures:
- **HTTPS Encryption**: All API communications are encrypted
- **Local Storage Only**: Sensitive data never leaves your device
- **No Remote Code**: Extension doesn't execute external scripts
- **Minimal Data**: Only necessary tweet content is processed

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Access**: View what data is stored locally in your browser
- **Delete**: Remove all stored data by uninstalling the extension
- **Control**: Your API key and preferences are under your control
- **Transparency**: This policy explains exactly what we do with your data
